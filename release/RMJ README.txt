R?MJ - The Mystery Hospital English Patch (October 2022)
########################################################

## Intro ##
The events of R?MJ take place in the summer of 1999. Hajime and Tomowo rush to
the S.T.G. Hospital after hearing their friend Ryo was in a suspicious
motorcycle accident, but they're trapped in the hospital after an explosion
seals their exit. Together with Aya, a nurse who looks after Ryo, Hajime and
friends much find a way out while a deadly virus threatens to end their
search for freedom. There's something else amiss about this hospital, however.
Strange paintings depicting an ancient civilization decorate the hospital
walls. Just what is the Asmos Legend?

R?MJ is an interactive horror game with full voice-acting and movement like
Kenji Eno's D, where a video plays to show the player's selected movement.
In addition to looking around for items and solving puzzles, the player must
utilize the "5 senses button," which acts as an additional way to investigate.
Other characters will prompt you for these moments, such as "what's that smell?"

## Patch Instructions ##
* The patcher expects the BIN version of both discs*

### Windows ###
1. Select any number of .bin files you wish to patch.
2. Drag and drop them on the file called "Drag and drop BIN(s) on me.bat"
3. If a valid disc image is found, patched .bin/.cue files will be created
   in this folder.

### Other OS ###
This release uses a basic .xdelta patch, so any web-based patching tool or
OS-specific .xdelta patcher should work okay. We've switched from xdelta3
to xdelta to help with compatability. The .xdelta files are located in the
"patch_data" folder. Apply the appropriate patch to each disc.

## Tips ##
- The X button acts as a "5 senses" button. If a character says something
  like "did you hear that?" or "what's that smell?" then press X to react
  to it. Sometimes the prompt disappears if you're slow, so try spinning
  around and trying again.
- A spoiler-free walkthrough has been included to reference in case you get
  lost. It's not as bad about "go to this specific spot" as ...iru! is,
  but there's a few confusing points early on.
- This game *only* supports autosaving! As long as you have a memory card in,
  the game will save at key locations. Dying will take you back to the last
  auto save.
- NO FEAR!
